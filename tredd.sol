// the buyer contacts the seller out of band to receive an encrypted copy of the data.

// The buyer then has until a later deadline to claim a refund
// if it turns out that the decryption key was wrong,
// or the decrypted content is.
// After that deadline, the seller may collect payment from the contract.
